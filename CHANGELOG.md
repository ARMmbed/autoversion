1.2.0 (2019-11-15)
==================

### Features

- Uses the [Official SemVer](https://pypi.org/project/semver) project to handle semver parsing and incrementing (#1)

- Supports a workflow where newsfiles aren't deleted, but relevant news is instead detected based on whether they were added since the previous release. (#2)

- Adds the ability to have "infinite" newsfiles. They no longer require cleaning up, if tags are used to indicate releases.
    This requires a workflow where releases are tagged in git, so we can determine the "new news". (infinite)
